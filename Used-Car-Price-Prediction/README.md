# Used Car Price Prediction
Project Description

The Used Car Price Prediction project aims to create a reliable machine learning model that can estimate the market value of used cars based on historical data, including technical specifications, trim versions, and prices. This project addresses the common problem faced by both sellers and buyers in determining the accurate value of used vehicles, helping to prevent undervaluation or overpricing.
Key Features:

    Data preprocessing and cleaning to ensure high-quality inputs.
    Implementation of various regression models such as Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and LightGBM.
    Model evaluation and comparison using metrics like RMSE (Root Mean Square Error).
    Optimization of models to balance prediction accuracy and computational efficiency.

Findings & Insights:

The Decision Tree model emerged as the most balanced option, offering a significant reduction in RMSE compared to the Linear Regression model while maintaining a fast prediction time. The Random Forest model, despite having the lowest RMSE, was computationally expensive, making it less practical for real-time predictions.
