# Negative Review Detection Model
Project Description

The Negative Review Detection Model is designed to identify and classify negative reviews from a large dataset of customer feedback. This project leverages natural language processing (NLP) techniques to automatically detect sentiment in text, providing businesses with valuable insights to address customer concerns and improve overall satisfaction.
Key Features:

    Text preprocessing including tokenization, stopword removal, and stemming/lemmatization.
    Implementation of various machine learning models such as Logistic Regression and Light GBM to classify reviews as positive or negative.
    Use of NLP techniques like TF-IDF vectorization to convert text data into numerical format.
    Model evaluation using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to compare performance.

Findings & Insights:

The project successfully identified patterns in customer reviews, with the best-performing model achieving an F1-score of 0.88. This model allows businesses to quickly and efficiently identify negative reviews and take proactive steps to address customer issues.
